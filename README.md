This is the OCamlbuild plugin that was previously included as part of Jane
Street's `ppx_driver`, but which was deleted at some point and no longer exists
in `ppxlib` either.

- [ppxlib](https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppxlib)
- [ppx_driver](https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_driver) (deprecated)

This exists for backwards compatibility.  You may want to consider using `dune`
(aka `jbuilder`) instead.
